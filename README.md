# Errand Planner

A google maps route management app that allows you to create routes between
locations and generate a google maps directions link that you can use to
navigate the most efficient path to visit each location.

Have 4 errands to run on the way home from work and want to minimize
your travel time taking traffic into account? Create a route in the Errand
planner app, add your errand locations, and click "Optimize" to generate a
google maps link that will guide you along the most efficient path between
your errand locations and then home!
